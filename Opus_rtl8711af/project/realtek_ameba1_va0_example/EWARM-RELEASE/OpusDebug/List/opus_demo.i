/*
 * Support of locale interface
 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and
 * contry-specific settings for a number of areas, including currency
 * symbols, date and time, and multibyte encodings.
 *
 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.
 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, the locale interface exist
 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings is choosen by defining any
 * number of _LOCALE_USE_xxx and _ENCODING_USE_xxx symbols. The application
 * will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is always
 * supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. One preselected locale and one preselected encoding is then used
 * directly. That locale can not be changed during runtime. The preselected
 * locale and encoding is choosen by defining at most one of _LOCALE_USE_xxx
 * and at most one of _ENCODING_USE_xxx. The default is to use the "C" locale
 * and the single byte encoding, respectively.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for the locale interface with the "C"
 * locale and the single byte encoding.

 * Description
 * -----------
 *
 * If locks are to be used (_DLIB_MULTI_THREAD != 0), the following options
 * has to be used in ilink: 
 *   --redirect __iar_Locksyslock=__iar_Locksyslock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Unlocksyslock=__iar_Unlocksyslock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Lockfilelock=__iar_Lockfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Unlockfilelock=__iar_Unlockfilelock_mtx
 *   --keep     __iar_Locksyslock_mtx
 * and, if C++ is used, also:
 *   --redirect __iar_Initdynamicfilelock=__iar_Initdynamicfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Dstdynamicfilelock=__iar_Dstdynamicfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Lockdynamicfilelock=__iar_Lockdynamicfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Unlockdynamicfilelock=__iar_Unlockdynamicfilelock_mtx
 * Xlink uses similar options (-e and -g). The following lock interface must
 * also be implemented: 
 *   typedef void *__iar_Rmtx;                   // Lock info object
 *
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxinit(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Initialize a system lock
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxdst(__iar_Rmtx *);     // Destroy a system lock
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxlock(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Lock a system lock
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxunlock(__iar_Rmtx *);  // Unlock a system lock
 * The interface handles locks for the heap, the locale, the file system
 * structure, the initialization of statics in functions, etc. 
 *
 * The following lock interface is optional to be implemented:
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxinit(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Initialize a file lock
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxdst(__iar_Rmtx *);     // Destroy a file lock
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxlock(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Lock a file lock
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxunlock(__iar_Rmtx *);  // Unlock a file lock
 * The interface handles locks for each file stream.
 * 
 * These three once-initialization symbols must also be defined, if the 
 * default initialization later on in this file doesn't work (done in 
 * DLib_product.h):
 *
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_TYPE
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_MACRO(control_variable, init_function)
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_TYPE_INIT
 *
 * If an external TLS interface is used, the following must
 * be defined:
 *   typedef int __iar_Tlskey_t;
 *   typedef void (*__iar_Tlsdtor_t)(void *);
 *   int __iar_Tlsalloc(__iar_Tlskey_t *, __iar_Tlsdtor_t); 
 *                                                    // Allocate a TLS element
 *   int __iar_Tlsfree(__iar_Tlskey_t);               // Free a TLS element
 *   int __iar_Tlsset(__iar_Tlskey_t, void *);        // Set a TLS element
 *   void *__iar_Tlsget(__iar_Tlskey_t);              // Get a TLS element

 *
 * The Opus codec is designed to handle a wide range of interactive audio applications,
 * including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even remote live music
 * performances. It can scale from low bit-rate narrowband speech to very high quality
 * stereo music. Its main features are:

 * @li Sampling rates from 8 to 48 kHz
 * @li Bit-rates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s
 * @li Support for both constant bit-rate (CBR) and variable bit-rate (VBR)
 * @li Audio bandwidth from narrowband to full-band
 * @li Support for speech and music
 * @li Support for mono and stereo
 * @li Support for multichannel (up to 255 channels)
 * @li Frame sizes from 2.5 ms to 60 ms
 * @li Good loss robustness and packet loss concealment (PLC)
 * @li Floating point and fixed-point implementation

/** @defgroup opus_encoder Opus Encoder
  * @{
  *
  * @brief This page describes the process and functions used to encode Opus.
  *
  * Since Opus is a stateful codec, the encoding process starts with creating an encoder
  * state. This can be done with:
  *
  * @code
  * int          error;
  * OpusEncoder *enc;
  * enc = opus_encoder_create(Fs, channels, application, &error);
  * @endcode
  *
  * From this point, @c enc can be used for encoding an audio stream. An encoder state
  * @b must @b not be used for more than one stream at the same time. Similarly, the encoder
  * state @b must @b not be re-initialized for each frame.
  *
  * While opus_encoder_create() allocates memory for the state, it's also possible
  * to initialize pre-allocated memory:
  *
  * @code
  * int          size;
  * int          error;
  * OpusEncoder *enc;
  * size = opus_encoder_get_size(channels);
  * enc = malloc(size);
  * error = opus_encoder_init(enc, Fs, channels, application);
  * @endcode
  *
  * where opus_encoder_get_size() returns the required size for the encoder state. Note that
  * future versions of this code may change the size, so no assuptions should be made about it.
  *
  * The encoder state is always continuous in memory and only a shallow copy is sufficient
  * to copy it (e.g. memcpy())
  *
  * It is possible to change some of the encoder's settings using the opus_encoder_ctl()
  * interface. All these settings already default to the recommended value, so they should
  * only be changed when necessary. The most common settings one may want to change are:
  *
  * @code
  * opus_encoder_ctl(enc, OPUS_SET_BITRATE(bitrate));
  * opus_encoder_ctl(enc, OPUS_SET_COMPLEXITY(complexity));
  * opus_encoder_ctl(enc, OPUS_SET_SIGNAL(signal_type));
  * @endcode
  *
  * where
  *
  * @arg bitrate is in bits per second (b/s)
  * @arg complexity is a value from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest complexity and 10 is the highest
  * @arg signal_type is either OPUS_AUTO (default), OPUS_SIGNAL_VOICE, or OPUS_SIGNAL_MUSIC
  *
  * See @ref opus_encoderctls and @ref opus_genericctls for a complete list of parameters that can be set or queried. Most parameters can be set or changed at any time during a stream.
  *
  * To encode a frame, opus_encode() or opus_encode_float() must be called with exactly one frame (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 ms) of audio data:
  * @code
  * len = opus_encode(enc, audio_frame, frame_size, packet, max_packet);
  * @endcode
  *
  * where
  * <ul>
  * <li>audio_frame is the audio data in opus_int16 (or float for opus_encode_float())</li>
  * <li>frame_size is the duration of the frame in samples (per channel)</li>
  * <li>packet is the byte array to which the compressed data is written</li>
  * <li>max_packet is the maximum number of bytes that can be written in the packet (4000 bytes is recommended).
  *     Do not use max_packet to control VBR target bitrate, instead use the #OPUS_SET_BITRATE CTL.</li>
  * </ul>
  *
  * opus_encode() and opus_encode_float() return the number of bytes actually written to the packet.
  * The return value <b>can be negative</b>, which indicates that an error has occurred. If the return value
  * is 2 bytes or less, then the packet does not need to be transmitted (DTX).
  *
  * Once the encoder state if no longer needed, it can be destroyed with
  *
  * @code
  * opus_encoder_destroy(enc);
  * @endcode
  *
  * If the encoder was created with opus_encoder_init() rather than opus_encoder_create(),
  * then no action is required aside from potentially freeing the memory that was manually
  * allocated for it (calling free(enc) for the example above)
  *

 *    mode for typical VoIP applications. Because of the enhancement,
 *    even at high bitrates the output may sound different from the input.
 *
 * @ref OPUS_APPLICATION_AUDIO gives best quality at a given bitrate for most

  * @li error will hold the error code in case of failure (or #OPUS_OK on success)
  * @li the return value is a newly created decoder state to be used for decoding
  *
  * While opus_decoder_create() allocates memory for the state, it's also possible
  * to initialize pre-allocated memory:
  * @code
  * int          size;
  * int          error;
  * OpusDecoder *dec;
  * size = opus_decoder_get_size(channels);
  * dec = malloc(size);
  * error = opus_decoder_init(dec, Fs, channels);
  * @endcode
  * where opus_decoder_get_size() returns the required size for the decoder state. Note that
  * future versions of this code may change the size, so no assuptions should be made about it.
  *
  * The decoder state is always continuous in memory and only a shallow copy is sufficient
  * to copy it (e.g. memcpy())
  *
  * To decode a frame, opus_decode() or opus_decode_float() must be called with a packet of compressed audio data:
  * @code
  * frame_size = opus_decode(dec, packet, len, decoded, max_size, 0);
  * @endcode
  * where
  *
  * @li packet is the byte array containing the compressed data
  * @li len is the exact number of bytes contained in the packet
  * @li decoded is the decoded audio data in opus_int16 (or float for opus_decode_float())
  * @li max_size is the max duration of the frame in samples (per channel) that can fit into the decoded_frame array
  *
  * opus_decode() and opus_decode_float() return the number of samples (per channel) decoded from the packet.
  * If that value is negative, then an error has occurred. This can occur if the packet is corrupted or if the audio
  * buffer is too small to hold the decoded audio.
  *
  * Opus is a stateful codec with overlapping blocks and as a result Opus
  * packets are not coded independently of each other. Packets must be
  * passed into the decoder serially and in the correct order for a correct
  * decode. Lost packets can be replaced with loss concealment by calling
  * the decoder with a null pointer and zero length for the missing packet.
  *
  * A single codec state may only be accessed from a single thread at
  * a time and any required locking must be performed by the caller. Separate
  * streams must be decoded with separate decoder states and can be decoded
  * in parallel unless the library was compiled with NONTHREADSAFE_PSEUDOSTACK
  * defined.

/** @defgroup opus_repacketizer Repacketizer
  * @{
  *
  * The repacketizer can be used to merge multiple Opus packets into a single
  * packet or alternatively to split Opus packets that have previously been
  * merged. Splitting valid Opus packets is always guaranteed to succeed,
  * whereas merging valid packets only succeeds if all frames have the same
  * mode, bandwidth, and frame size, and when the total duration of the merged
  * packet is no more than 120 ms. The 120 ms limit comes from the
  * specification and limits decoder memory requirements at a point where
  * framing overhead becomes negligible.
  *
  * The repacketizer currently only operates on elementary Opus
  * streams. It will not manipualte multistream packets successfully, except in
  * the degenerate case where they consist of data from a single stream.
  *
  * The repacketizing process starts with creating a repacketizer state, either
  * by calling opus_repacketizer_create() or by allocating the memory yourself,
  * e.g.,
  * @code
  * OpusRepacketizer *rp;
  * rp = (OpusRepacketizer*)malloc(opus_repacketizer_get_size());
  * if (rp != NULL)
  *     opus_repacketizer_init(rp);
  * @endcode
  *
  * Then the application should submit packets with opus_repacketizer_cat(),
  * extract new packets with opus_repacketizer_out() or
  * opus_repacketizer_out_range(), and then reset the state for the next set of
  * input packets via opus_repacketizer_init().
  *
  * For example, to split a sequence of packets into individual frames:
  * @code
  * unsigned char *data;
  * int len;
  * while (get_next_packet(&data, &len))
  * {
  *   unsigned char out[1276];
  *   opus_int32 out_len;
  *   int nb_frames;
  *   int err;
  *   int i;
  *   err = opus_repacketizer_cat(rp, data, len);
  *   if (err != OPUS_OK)
  *   {
  *     release_packet(data);
  *     return err;
  *   }
  *   nb_frames = opus_repacketizer_get_nb_frames(rp);
  *   for (i = 0; i < nb_frames; i++)
  *   {
  *     out_len = opus_repacketizer_out_range(rp, i, i+1, out, sizeof(out));
  *     if (out_len < 0)
  *     {
  *        release_packet(data);
  *        return (int)out_len;
  *     }
  *     output_next_packet(out, out_len);
  *   }
  *   opus_repacketizer_init(rp);
  *   release_packet(data);
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * Alternatively, to combine a sequence of frames into packets that each
  * contain up to <code>TARGET_DURATION_MS</code> milliseconds of data:
  * @code
  * // The maximum number of packets with duration TARGET_DURATION_MS occurs
  * // when the frame size is 2.5 ms, for a total of (TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/5)
  * // packets.
  * unsigned char *data[(TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/5)+1];

/** @defgroup opus_custom Opus Custom
  * @{
  *  Opus Custom is an optional part of the Opus specification and
  * reference implementation which uses a distinct API from the regular
  * API and supports frame sizes that are not normally supported.\ Use
  * of Opus Custom is discouraged for all but very special applications
  * for which a frame size different from 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 ms is needed
  * (for either complexity or latency reasons) and where interoperability
  * is less important.
  *
  * In addition to the interoperability limitations the use of Opus custom
  * disables a substantial chunk of the codec and generally lowers the
  * quality available at a given bitrate. Normally when an application needs
  * a different frame size from the codec it should buffer to match the
  * sizes but this adds a small amount of delay which may be important
  * in some very low latency applications. Some transports (especially
  * constant rate RF transports) may also work best with frames of
  * particular durations.
  *
  * Libopus only supports custom modes if they are enabled at compile time.
  *
  * The Opus Custom API is similar to the regular API but the
  * @ref opus_encoder_create and @ref opus_decoder_create calls take
  * an additional mode parameter which is a structure produced by
  * a call to @ref opus_custom_mode_create. Both the encoder and decoder
  * must create a mode using the same sample rate (fs) and frame size
  * (frame size) so these parameters must either be signaled out of band
  * or fixed in a particular implementation.
  *
  * Similar to regular Opus the custom modes support on the fly frame size
  * switching, but the sizes available depend on the particular frame size in
  * use. For some initial frame sizes on a single on the fly size is available.

/** @defgroup opus_multistream Opus Multistream API
  * @{
  *
  * The multistream API allows individual Opus streams to be combined into a
  * single packet, enabling support for up to 255 channels. Unlike an
  * elementary Opus stream, the encoder and decoder must negotiate the channel
  * configuration before the decoder can successfully interpret the data in the
  * packets produced by the encoder. Some basic information, such as packet
  * duration, can be computed without any special negotiation.
  *
  * The format for multistream Opus packets is defined in
  * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7845">RFC 7845</a>
  * and is based on the self-delimited Opus framing described in Appendix B of
  * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6716">RFC 6716</a>.
  * Normal Opus packets are just a degenerate case of multistream Opus packets,
  * and can be encoded or decoded with the multistream API by setting
  * <code>streams</code> to <code>1</code> when initializing the encoder or
  * decoder.
  *
  * Multistream Opus streams can contain up to 255 elementary Opus streams.
  * These may be either "uncoupled" or "coupled", indicating that the decoder
  * is configured to decode them to either 1 or 2 channels, respectively.
  * The streams are ordered so that all coupled streams appear at the
  * beginning.
  *
  * A <code>mapping</code> table defines which decoded channel <code>i</code>
  * should be used for each input/output (I/O) channel <code>j</code>. This table is
  * typically provided as an unsigned char array.
  * Let <code>i = mapping[j]</code> be the index for I/O channel <code>j</code>.
  * If <code>i < 2*coupled_streams</code>, then I/O channel <code>j</code> is
  * encoded as the left channel of stream <code>(i/2)</code> if <code>i</code>
  * is even, or  as the right channel of stream <code>(i/2)</code> if
  * <code>i</code> is odd. Otherwise, I/O channel <code>j</code> is encoded as
  * mono in stream <code>(i - coupled_streams)</code>, unless it has the special
  * value 255, in which case it is omitted from the encoding entirely (the
  * decoder will reproduce it as silence). Each value <code>i</code> must either
  * be the special value 255 or be less than <code>streams + coupled_streams</code>.
  *
  * The output channels specified by the encoder
  * should use the
  * <a href="https://www.xiph.org/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html#x1-810004.3.9">Vorbis
  * channel ordering</a>. A decoder may wish to apply an additional permutation
  * to the mapping the encoder used to achieve a different output channel
  * order (e.g. for outputing in WAV order).
  *
  * Each multistream packet contains an Opus packet for each stream, and all of
  * the Opus packets in a single multistream packet must have the same
  * duration. Therefore the duration of a multistream packet can be extracted
  * from the TOC sequence of the first stream, which is located at the
  * beginning of the packet, just like an elementary Opus stream:
  *
  * @code
  * int nb_samples;
  * int nb_frames;
  * nb_frames = opus_packet_get_nb_frames(data, len);
  * if (nb_frames < 1)
  *   return nb_frames;
  * nb_samples = opus_packet_get_samples_per_frame(data, 48000) * nb_frames;
  * @endcode
  *
  * The general encoding and decoding process proceeds exactly the same as in
  * the normal @ref opus_encoder and @ref opus_decoder APIs.
  * See their documentation for an overview of how to use the corresponding
  * multistream functions.
